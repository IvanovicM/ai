# Magic Square: AI approach
Multiple AI algorithms which solve [Magic Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square).

## What algorithms can I find here?

### Greedy Search

### Simulated Annealing

### Local Beam Search

### Genetic Algorithm

## How to run these algorithms?

To run test script simply type the following command from the root directory in a terminal:

```shell
  python -m source.test.test
```

If you want to see statistics for the methods, simply type the following command(s) from the root directory in a terminal:

```shell
  python -m source.test.test_stats
  python -m source.test.test_statsplot
```

Have fun!
